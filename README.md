Enterprise marketing typically uses one of two major strategies: (1) mass campaigns that target a large number of general consumers, or (2) directed marketing that targets a particular group of consumers. The mass campaign tactic is not very effective in this cutthroat society. However, there are obstacles to focused marketing. Finding potential clients is difficult, despite the fact that data mining (DM) techniques are helping in this area.

The dataset provided comes from a Portuguese bank, which employed it in a direct-marketing effort to promote term deposits among its clientele. It is comparable to cross-selling. The dataset contains general information on customers, information about contacts made with them, and the output variable y, which shows whether or not the customer enrolled to a term deposit. The campaign was mostly based on phone calls.
